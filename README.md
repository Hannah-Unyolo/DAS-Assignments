HEAP DATA STRUCTURE

A heap is a tree-like data structure where each parent node is either greater than or equal to or less than or equal to its child node.

ADVANTAGES

1. Helps in finding the maximum and minimum elements
2. No limit on memory size
3. Allows access to variables globally

DISADVANTAGES

1. Lack of flexibility
2. Not ideal for searching
3. Memory management
4. Complexity
  
PROPERTIES

1. Shape Property
2. Complete binary tree

APPLICATION OF HEAPS

1. Priority Queues: Heaps are often utilized as a means of implementing priority queues. This allows for elements with higher priority to be extracted first, ensuring that the most important tasks are handled promptly.

2. Heapsort algorithm: It is used to handle large datasets without slowing down

3. Graph Algorithms: Heaps allow algorithms to efficiently track and prioritize nodes or vertices based on their distance or weight from the starting point, hence increasing the speed at finding paths or trees


TUPLE DATA STRUCTURE

Tuples are a type of data structure that stores a collection of objects separated by commas.

ADVANTAGES

1. Faster than lists

2. Protects code from accidental modification

3. Can be used as dictionary keys

DISADVANTAGES
1. They cannot be changed
2. Less flexible due to its immutability

PROPERTIES
1. They are indexed
2. They are ordered
3. They are immutable
4. Contain duplicate items

APPLICATION
1. Storing immutable sequences of items
2. Returning multiple values from a function
