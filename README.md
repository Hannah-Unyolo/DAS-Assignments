Heap Data Structure
Heap is a tree-like data structure where each parent node is either greater than or equal to or less than or equal to its child node.

Advantages
Helps in finding maximum and minimum elements
No limit on memory size
Allows access of variables globally

Disadvantages
Lack of flexibility
Not  ideal for searching
Memory management
Complexity

Properties
Shape Property
Complete binary tree

Application of Heaps
Priority Queues: Heaps are often utilized as a means of implementing priority queues. This allows for elements with higher priority to be extracted first, ensuring that the most important tasks are handled in a timely manner.

Heapsort algorithm: It is used to handle large datasets  without slowing down

Graph Algorithms: Heaps allows algorithms to efficiently track and prioritize nodes or vertices based on their distance or weight from the starting point, hence increasing the speed at finding paths or trees
